Get to know a littleThe database administrator — or simply DBA — is a critically important role in many of today’s IT departments, and by extension, their organizations overall. The DBA is the person who manages, backs up and ensures the availability of the mountains of data produced and consumed by today’s organizations via their IT systems. Database administrators develop, install, test, troubleshoot and safeguard the massive data systems inside corporations that store information. Database developers work on commercial or e-commerce websites. They develop and secure the network structures that store and return information based on Internet queries.
        So, the question that arises now is, How to become a DBA? or From where should I begin?<br>
        1.For that, the first and foremost thing is to start learning the SQL programming language. SQL is the programming language that database queries are written in.<br>
        2.Then you need to check various kind of databases available and their working. And according to that, you need to choose one of the kind and make some case study on these.<br>
        3.A good DBA should pose experience in database designing which is essentially responsible for any further working of the project.<br>
        4.Designing of the database includes a case study of the problem set (often call as use cases), aERD of the proposed schema (nowadays EERD are more preferred than ERD). For any single problem statement there are various ERD available, but while designing our own, we need to keep in mind that what is the scope of our project and how much alteration can it have in future.<br>
        5.After designing the database, the next important thing is the queries. Complexity of queries affects the overall performance of the project as they directly affect the response time of the system.<br>
        6.The integrity and security of the data in a database are what we cannot ignore. So, while designing and developing any database we need to check the integrity of data and its security in terms of protection from any kind of data leak and data loss. better, and make the right move with your brand and campaign.</p>
